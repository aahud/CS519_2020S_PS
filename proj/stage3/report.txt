Problem:
	Succinctly stated, Animal rights advocates from the Austin Animal Center and the ASPCA have put together data for shelter animals, including various pheno traits and whether or not they were adopted. It is the desire of these organizations, and our goal, to use this data to try and accurately predict the likely outcomes for animals when they leave the shelter. If the outcome for a particular animal can be predicted, then more effort can be put into finding homes for those less likely to be adopted. 

Solution:

	Machine Learning can be implemented to determine if a shelter animal has a high chance of being adopted or not. This will require a high amount of data preprocessing, as the initial data is highly categorical. Fortunately it's also distict without too many levels, so a labler can be used to get numerical values for use. The key traits that will be used for training will be AnimalType, AgeuponOutcome, SexuponOutcome, and OutcomeType. OutcomeType will be the training target. 

	Since this outcome relies on so many traits, a simple classifier will likely not give good results. Thus the group will use ensemble methods for predictions, though the inclusion of a more basic learner such as a support vector machine may be worth trying simply for comparison.
